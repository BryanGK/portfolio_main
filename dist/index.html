                            <div class="subheading mb-3">The story so far...</div>
                            <p>My journey to becoming a software developer began 3 years ago when I decided it was time for a career change. So I quit my job and began my search for a new career field. Well, unfortunately that didn't quite go as expected. Through a career coach I did a lot of exercises and thorough self-analysis, and it resulted in me returning back to being an electrician. Going into industrial electrical, I thought things would be different. I was wrong.</p>
                            <p>When that didn't work out it was my partner who had suggested that I try getting into UI design. I was artistic and had an eye for design, so I figured it would be a good fit. During a work slow down I was laid-off and this was a perfect opportunity to pursue my new career in design. The first couple months of design school went well, until I began to dred doing the work. Uh-oh I though, this is not a good sign. The whole time though, I would be making these designs and it would occur to me that being able to actually build these designs would seem to be very rewarding. And that's how I discovered my new passion, software development.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my life I have always had a deep fascination with computers and what makes them work. There was a mystic that I could no longer ignore, and once I began to learn to code I knew I had arrived. And, what's this? You can teach yourself to code and land a cool job! I had finally found the career that really excites me.</p>
                            <p>Becoming a self-taught developer is very tough. The lack of structure and direction makes this a tricky proposition. I decided that if I really wanted this that I would need some help. That's when I discovered the Software Developer Mastermind program. In this program you are pushed beyond your comfrort zone and made to build projects that get progressively more difficult and complex. Building projects has skyrocketed my skills to the next level, giving me the confidence I need to get ahead. I am so excited for where this career will take me in the future, there is no limit.</p>

                                Going into this project I knew there would be a lot of information to research. This was the first time I had attempted to create a custom API and make calls through my server to Twitters own API. To begin with I made up simple wireframe mockups to give me a starting point and base model to refer to when I got stuck. After completing some wireframe mockups in Sketch and having a basic app outline, I began creating my client-side functionality. This was my first time making an SPA (single page application) with page routing, to accommodate a Home, Search, and Random Tweet pages. Now that the client had something to display, it was time to tackle the server. Through some excellent online resources and asking questions of my mentor and tutor, I was able to get the backend up and functioning. And now finally to connect it all together into one seamless experience. Wow! What a feeling that was seeing information being passed back and forth from the client to
                                the backend for the first time. With my minimum viable product up and running it was now time to add styling. Having resources like Unsplash and frameworks such as Bootstrap are invaluable tool to get great styling results. My home page image was critical in selecting the colours and fonts to really tie everything together into my first successful full-stack application.

                                Moving head first into C# and to the classes and object-oriented programming was a big shift in thinking from Javascript. The best way forward was through, so I bought a big book and grabbed an online tutorial and began learning. And just when I was beginning to feel comfortable Javascript, I had to start all over again. No problem though, I enjoy learning and relish the idea of picking up new languages. Learning C# and seeing how much it can do is awe-inspiring to me. I had a to really think about how I wanted to structure my program. Using a 2D array I managed to display a game grid with numbers to indicated columns and rows. Creating the game logic was where things got difficult. I had to devise a way of keeping track of all the different variables like hit count, shot count, and the battleship location. Through encapsulation, and by singling out a Player class, a Battleship class, and a Display class, I was able to separate concerns and make the
                                program extensible in the future. Upon completing this app I was primed in C# and ready for more opportunity to use my newfound knowledge.

                                This was at the time only the second application I had built using React. Getting my head wrapped around a front end framework like React was challenging to say the least. On my first app using React I used class based components, setting state that way. However on this app I really wanted to make use of hooks to set my state, I felt this was a crucial part of React that needed to be learned. Another layer of complexity added to this project was making HTTP requests to an external API. I decided to make use of the axios library to make life easier. The Star Wars API, on some results, will return only another API endpoint. The task of making additional requests and the awaiting the data before setting state was quite difficult to figure out at first. To get through and make the proper calls I really had to knuckle down and cement in the concepts of async/await and how promises work. With those conepts in action, it was time to style my page using
                                Bootstrap. A wonderful library of components to be added without much trouble. Having dynamic pagination was a cool feature that I knew I wanted to implement. What a great learning experience this app was, it was exciting to feel like a real developer after completion.
