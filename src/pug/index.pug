                            p
                                | My journey to becoming a software developer began 3 years ago when I decided it was time for a career change. So I quit my job and began my search for a new career field. Well, unfortunately that didn't quite go as expected. Through a career coach I did a lot of exercises and thorough self-analysis, and it resulted in me returning back to being an electrician. Going into industrial electrical, I thought things would be different. I was wrong.
                            p 
                                | When that didn't work out it was my partner who had suggested that I try getting into UI design. I was artistic and had an eye for design, so I figured it would be a good fit. During a work slow down I was laid-off and this was a perfect opportunity to pursue my new career in design. The first couple months of design school went well, until I began to dred doing the work. Uh-oh I though, this is not a good sign. The whole time though, I would be making these designs and it would occur to me that being able to actually build these designs would seem to be very rewarding. And that's how I discovered my new passion, software development.
                            p 
                                | Throughout my life I have always had a deep fascination with computers and what makes them work. There was a mystic that I could no longer ignore, and once I began to learn to code I knew I had arrived. I had finally found the career that really excites me. 
                            p 
                                | Becoming a self-taught developer is very tough. The lack of structure and direction makes this a tricky proposition. I decided that if I really wanted this that I would need some help. That's when I discovered the Software Developer Mastermind program. In this program you are pushed beyond your comfrort zone and made to build projects that progressively more difficult and complex. I am so excited for where this career will take me in the future, there is no limit.
